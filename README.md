Every professor faces this daily struggle:
 ⏳ spending precious time checking attendance, marking absentees, sending emails, and preparing weekly reports.
Sounds simple, right? But in reality, it’s repetitive, time-consuming, and prone to errors. 😵‍💫

That’s when our team asked ourselves:
 👉 “Why not let a bot handle this — faster, smarter, and better?”💡➡️🤖

And that’s how our journey began under the USC.KIIT Program – Empowering Automation Season 2.0. Guided by our mentors Kavya Mahato, Ankita Mohanty, and super mentors Bhavya Prakash, Avirup Banerjee & Saptak Das, we built something powerful using UiPath Studio.

Here’s how it works (UiPath activities behind the magic ✨):

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗦𝗻𝗮𝗽𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘁 🔍
 ✔️ Auto-detects the latest attendance date column
 🧭 Identifies students marked Absent for that date
 ✉️ Sends personalized absence emails (only once per absence)
 📝 Updates Excel with Status [Date] = "Email Sent"
 📊 Generates weekly attendance reports for department review

𝗤𝘂𝗶𝗰𝗸 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗪𝗮𝗹𝗸𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵 ⚙️

📊 Excel Process Scope + Read Range → 📂 Read Excel → Pulls in Prof. Bhavya’s daily attendance
🔎 Detect latest date column → Assign → latestDate
🔍 For Each Row + If Condition → Spots students marked absent by checking latestDate for "A"
📧 Send Email (Send Outlook / SMTP) — Sends personalized absence emails
🧾 Update Excel → Add/Update Status [Date]
✍ Write Range → Updates Excel with “Email Sent” logs
🛡 Assign + If Check → Prevents duplicate notifications
📑 Build weekly report → Build DataTable → Write Range / export

✨ Impact: What once took 30 minutes manually now takes just 2 minutes ⏱️ — error-free ✅, reliable 💯, and scalable 📈.
